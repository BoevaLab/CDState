CDState is an unsupervised deconvolution method for tumor bulk RNA-sequencing data, aimed at identifying malignant cell states and their proportions.

## Usage

To run CDState make sure the required python packages (cdstate_requirements.txt) are installed in your environment.

Use CDState_run.py file to see an exemplary pipeline.
